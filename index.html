            This paper studies the relationships between consumer demand and public health in firearm markets, and their roles in determining the impacts of firearm regulation. My analysis utilizes 20 years of administrative data from California, recording all licit handgun purchases in the state, the consumer and retailer in each transaction, and the universe of fatality incidents. Isolating variation from the entry timing of firearm retailers in local markets, the presence of an additional firearm retailer increases handgun purchases by 20 percent. The consumers marginal to retailer entry are both repeat and first-time handgun purchasers, and these marginal handgun owners increase both homicide and suicide fatalities. To study the trade-off between consumer surplus and public health, I develop and estimate a model of consumer handgun purchase and its impact on fatalities. My estimates imply that handgun owners are adversely selected---those with a higher willingness to pay for a handgun also generate more expected fatalities---such that the expected public health costs of handgun ownership outweigh the private benefits of handgun purchase. Using the model to simulate counterfactual policies, California's 2024 sales tax on firearm purchase approximately maximizes tax revenues, but is too low when accounting for consumer surplus and public health. By targeting high taxes to areas where adverse selection is most severe, the welfare gains from statewide taxation could be achieved with greater consumer surplus through high rates around San Francisco and Los Angeles, while leaving the rest of the state at the status quo.

            This paper studies the role of market structure and regulation in determining market surplus and social welfare from the consumer firearms industry in the United States. We construct a dataset combining the prices and characteristics of firearms available to consumers, microdata on firearm transactions from Massachusetts, and aggregate purchase quantities from other states. We account for price endogeneity by constructing a cost-shock instrument based on heterogeneous exposure to aggregate shocks in the costs of commodity metals, and estimate an own-price elasticity of -2.5 for the average firearm model. Utilizing this data and variation, we estimate a model of national supply and demand for consumer firearms. Although firearm manufacturers suppress quantity by pricing significantly above marginal cost, a calibrated measure of public health costs implies that the equilibrium firearm purchase quantity is still inefficiently high. We estimate that uniform increases to firearm taxes distribute welfare gains in a manner that is likely politically infeasible, causing particular harm to consumers in Republican-leaning areas. In contrast, targeting taxes on handguns alone can increase social welfare without harming consumer surplus.

          <div class="popup" id="abs_hunt" style="display:none;">
            This paper studies gun-use regulation and firearm mortality. I gather historical schedules of deer hunting season in North Carolina and Virginia and pair them with morgue records at county-day frequency. Hunters increase firearm use during deer season and sharply decrease use at season's end. The end of deer season in these states reduces firearm homicide fatalities by 45 percent of its daily average: 1 homicide every 3 years. Deer season homicides spill over onto women, who rarely hunt, but do not affect non-firearm fatalities. Public policies that encourage safer gun-use, even among lawful firearm owners, can decrease firearm injuries.

            This paper studies patterns of firearm acquisition during the COVID-19 pandemic. We construct individual-level histories of handgun acquisitions from administrative microdata on all licit handgun transfers in California 01/1996&ndash;09/2021. Our analysis contrasts trends in pandemic-era handgun acquisition between repeat and first-time acquirers, across demographic groups, and to the pre-pandemic period. Handgun acquisitions increased by 150% at the onset of the pandemic, then decreased to pre-pandemic rates after 18 months. First-time acquirers procured handguns at more than 100% of their pre-pandemic rate for 7 consecutive months. Racial/ethnic minorities and women sustained the largest percentage increases in first-time handgun acquisitions, while White men owned handguns at the highest rate before and after the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic created one of the strongest, most sustained increases in aggregate demand for firearms in the U.S. However, the size of the pre-pandemic stock, the dominance of usual gun buyers, and the trend towards pre-pandemic rates of handgun acquisition after the initial demand increase suggests that neither the overall distribution of firearm ownership nor population-level health risks are likely to alter meaningfully as a result.

            This paper studies the transmission of a county’s historical exposure to the U.S. frontier into contemporary preferences for consumer firearms. Counties with an additional decade on the frontier between 1790 and 1890 have 1.2 percent higher rates of firearm ownership than their less-exposed counterparts today. This is a large transmission of a county’s historical conditions: each decade on the frontier is equivalent to one-tenth of the gap in contemporary firearm ownership between Illinois and Texas. In response to nationwide shocks to the consumer firearms market, greater frontier exposure increases firearm purchasing and intensifies preferences for firearm regulation. The debate around contemporary firearm regulation should account for heterogeneity in its historical antecedents.

            The Massachusetts Firearms Records Bureau recently published administrative data covering the universe of legal firearm transactions in the state. We use these data to validate state-level background checks as a proxy for firearm transactions and show that historical trends in transactions within Massachusetts align with the rest of the United States. Using auxiliary data from a national survey, we show that the Massachusetts dataset can detect patterns in the demographics of both gun ownership and type of firearm purchased. Our analysis suggests that this dataset is a promising source of information for studying interactions in the market for legal firearms.

            We study a nutrition-sensitive agricultural program in low-income rural Zambia between 2011 and 2015. Using a pre-post design with a control group, we measure program effects along established pathways connecting agriculture to nutrition: diversity of agricultural production, crop sales, household food access and child and maternal diets. The program increased diversity in crops grown and the number of months in which various food groups were harvested. In particular, the program substantially increased the percentage of households producing three nutritious crops it promoted (groundnuts, rape and tomatoes). As a consequence there were modest increases in household access to diverse food groups. Despite modest increases in the proportion of children consuming pulses, legumes and nuts, ultimately there were no significant improvements in the overall dietary diversity of young children or their mothers. A nutrition-sensitive agricultural program can increase diversity in agricultural production and to a lesser extent access to nutritious foods, but this may not always be sufficient to improve child diets or nutrition.
